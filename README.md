# Space Shooter Game

A 2d space shooter game made with Pygame for educational purposes. Controls are arrow keys to move and Spacebar to shoot.

## Different Versions

Two folders have been created to separate the corrected version and uncorrected one where the student is going to work on.
The exercises are briefly described in comments of `# TODO`. 

## Play

Game is made with Python v.3 and above.

```
python3 init.py
```
